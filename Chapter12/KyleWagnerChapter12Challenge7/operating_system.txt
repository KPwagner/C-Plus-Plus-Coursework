an operating system , or OS, provides all of the most fundamental features of
a computer, at least from a software point of view. An OS enables you to use
the computer’s hardware devices, defines the user interface standards, and
provides the basic tools that begin to make the computer useful. Ultimately,
many of these features trace their way back to the OS’s kernel, which is
described in more detail next. other OS features are owed to additional
programs that run atop the kernel, as described later in this chapter.
